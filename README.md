Travelabulous
=============

A project we had to make for SYSC 3020 course in Carleton Univeristy. 

Jun 10 2014
----------
1. Added a basic setup (still have to add MVC structure)
2. Added model in app.py (will be separated into MVC after feedback from TA)
3. Added templates dir, housing the templates we will pipe data into. Currently contains a sample hello.html used to test routes.


Files includes
--------------
README.md 		# A README file for github to preview
requirements.txt	# I am using a virtualenv with pip to install these plugins/packages/modules. Simply type "pip install -r requirements.txt" to start hacking. 
Travelabulous\ 		# Folder contains the actual code.
